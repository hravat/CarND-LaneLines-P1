**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

Initially to get a feel of the project I picked up code similar to the quia given in the Udacity Quiz.
Once satisfied i slowly began replacing them with helper functions.
I had trouble with setting up the vertices.

Modifying the draw_lines was very challenging and I got some help by an approach suggested by oe of the mentors.
Finally after a lot of thought I implemented it.

There were silly mistakes like forgetting to put proper brackets which set me back by an hour but was tacked in the end.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

One potential shortcoming I see is that random lines appear in the videos
Also I could not complete the challenge due to an error I believe I have already handled.

Another potential shorcoming would be while driving uner conditions of low light.


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline
